# NewYear_2021
Project for the New Year's Eve. It is a Processing project where fireworks are blown into the air where they exlode and stick to the background, finally revealing a year.

## How it looks
Its just a bunch of colored circles so not much to expect but it was a fun little project.

## How it works
It just works, no docs needed. (Wokrs on my machine)

## How to run
It is a Processing project so you need to have Processing installed. [Processing Download page](https://processing.org/download) \
Then you just put all the project files into the same folder and run it using 'CTRL + R' or 'Play Button' inside Processing IDE.

## How to change things
Well I would love to tell you that all the variables that can be played with are easily accessible, but they are somewhere around in the code so you need to find them.

## Background
It was made in a few hours so its not the cleanest code you will ever see. Also, it was made a few years ago... I will probably remake it to newer version this year.

## Optimization
There is no optimization. Only naive approaches are in use. It gets laggy real quick.
